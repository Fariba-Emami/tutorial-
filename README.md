# How to use Github 101
Here is a summary of commands for pushing, pulling, and branching after connecting your local machine to the website.


## Remote or clone
## Method no. 1
Clone or download the existing repository from git:
``` git clone https://github.com/user_name/repository_name ```

## Method no. 2
1. Start git for a new folder:
``` git start ```
2. Access the existing repository from git:
``` git remote add origin https://github.com/user_name/repository_name ```
3. Check the access:
``` git remote -v ```


## Push
1. Add all changes (either files or new lines):
```git add```
2. Make modifications to a specific file:
``` git add "file_name.extension ```
3. Create a new commit with title A and description B:
``` git commit -m "A" -m "B" ```
4. Push the changes to Github:
``` git push origin main ``` or ```git push origin master```
5. To set a default branch for future pushes, we can use "-u" just before "origin master":
```git push -u origin master```


## Branching:
1. To check current branches:
``` git branch ```
2. To create a new branch named "feature-1":
``` git checkout -b feature-1 ```
3. To switch to the "master" branch:
``` git master checkout ```Â
