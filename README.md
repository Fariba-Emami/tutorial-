# How to use Github 101
Here is a summary of commands for pushing, pulling, and branching after connecting your local machine to the website.


## Remote or clone
## Method no. 1
to clone or download the existing repository from git:
"`` git clone https://github.com/user_name/repository_name "``


## Method no. 2
